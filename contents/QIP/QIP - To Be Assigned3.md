### Summary

Convert $500K in QiDAO Treasury WETH into staked sdBAL for 40%+ APR. Then distribute yield to aveQI stakers. 

### Abstract

Bridge $500K of Treasury held WETH on base chai to Ethereum. Convert to staked sdBAL on stakedao.org.
Distribute weekly yield as BAL to aveQi stakers. 

### Motivation
Higher aveQI yield will greatly increase investor interest in aveQI and encourage more participation in the QiDAO. 

QiDAO Protocol can utilize increases in the value of QI/increased investor interest in aveQI to strengthen MAI's peg.  

### Specification

### Rationale

QiDAO Treasury currently holds around $700K in sitting WETH that is not earning yield or otherwise creating benefit for anyone.

Converting $500K in WETH to staked sdBAL would more then double current aveQI staking revenues. 

If the QiDAO Protocol deploys Treasury held QI or wstQI with Treasury held MAI in Treasury owned LPs, then increasing the value and trade volume
of QI will strengthen MAI's peg and increase QiDAO Treasury revenues by creating buying pressure on MAI as QI raises + more MAI swap volume from 
arbitrage trade volume and by compounding Treasury owned MAI/QI LP fees to continually remove MAI from circulation.

The QiDAO Treasury and Protocol was initilly funded primarily by Qi Stakers. Putting 8% of the QiDAO Treasury to work towards providing returns
for aveQI stakers will show aveQI stakers that their investment is valued by the QiDAO. 

sdBAL yield is sustainable and will grow over time perportionate to Balancer's TVL and Volume. As Balancer V3 LPs reach mainstream adoption, sdBAL yield will likely increase significantly.
