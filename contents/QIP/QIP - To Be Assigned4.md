### Summary

QiDAO Protocol can strengthen MAI's peg and increase Protocol Revenue by deploying Treasury held MAI/QI into V2 LPs on Base and Polygon.  

### Abstract

Deploy 100% of QiDAO Treasury held QI(or wstQI) into V2 LPs with Treasury held MAI. Optionally, use $100-500K in underutilized Treasury tokens to buy additional Qi(or wstQ) to increase Treasury held Qi(or wstQI)/MAI LP TVL 

### Motivation
Strengthen MAI's Peg, increase the value of QI, and increase QiDAO Protocol revenues. 

### Specification

### Rationale

Treasury held MAI and QI currently provide little benefit besides keeping some MAI/QI out of circulation. 

Treasury owned MAI-QI (or wstQI) LPs would create signficiant automated arbitrage trade volume for all same chain MAI and QI LPs due to arbitrage bots trading ETH -> QI -> MAI -> USDC & USDC -> MAI -> QI -> ETH as the price of ETH fluctuates. 

Treasury owned MAI-QI LPs would strenghten MAI's peg by 
Capturing circulating MAI earned via LP swap fees
Capturing more circulating MAI from LP buying pressure as the value of QI/ETH increases.
Increasing MAI's liquidity over time from increases in value of QI/ETH + compounded LP swap fees. 

Increasing the amount of QiDAO Treasury held Qi(or wstQI) TVL will increase QiDAO Treasury TVL and yield as the value of QI increases. 
This QIP will have multiplied effectiveness when combined with the wstQI QIP and the increase aveQI staking yield QIP.

If downside selling pressure on MAI from QI/MAI LPs is a concern for MAI's PEG strength, then QI(or wstQI) can be held in reserve by the Treasury to beused to buy MAI during periods when QI/ETH is going down. Treasury held QI used this way can be re-gained via selling MAI for QI during periods when QI-ETH is greatly increasing and applying signfiicant buying pressure on MAI. 

### Technical Specification

Technical specifications pending based on QiDAO consensus on whether to and how much additional Qi to purchase and with what underutilized 
treasury tokens. 

### Configurable Values
